#   Azure Marketplace
 -----------
Welcome to the Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM). The Marketplace is an information and application marketplace. Marketplace simplifies publishing and consuming data of all types, as well as applications or services, even if they do not consume Marketplace data. The Marketplace enables developers and information workers to easily discover, purchase, and manage premium data subscriptions. The Marketplace provides both trusted public domain and premium commercial data via integrated consumption experiences and easy data discovery, exploration, and purchase on any platform. In addition, the Marketplace provides a centralized location where you can market or find and subscribe to applications and services.

 -----------
If you own and want to publish data or a application or service, the Marketplace extends the reach of your content through Microsoft’s global developer and information worker community. The Marketplace publishes your data as an OData feed so the ISV can concentrate on using your data rather than coding to a different data format for each dataset.
