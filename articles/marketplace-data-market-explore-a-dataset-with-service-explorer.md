#  Explore a Dataset with Service Explorer

 
 -----------

The Marketplace Service Explorer provides an easy to use interface where you can interactively consume and present datasets. With Service Explorer, you can query your datasets. If the dataset supports it, you can: 

- Create custom queries. 

- Export your data to any application that consumes OData. 

- Embed your data in an application or presentation. 

- Share the data with others.

###Prerequisites
Before you proceed make sure you have:

* A valid Windows Live ID or OrgID. 
If you need a Live ID go to the [Windows Live home page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=202643) and sign-up for a Live ID.


* A valid Marketplace account. If you do not have a Marketplace account, go to the topic [Create Your Marketplace Account](./marketplace-data-market-create-your-marketplace-account.md) and follow the instructions there.


* A subscription to a dataset of interest. If you have not subscribed to a dataset, go to the topic [Subscribe to a Data Offer](./marketplace-data-market-subscribe-to-a-data-offer.md) and follow the instructions there.


When you click **Explore this Dataset**, Service Explorer launches in a separate window or tab with one of these two results. 

1. The dataset has no required parameters (it may or may not have optional parameters). <br>Service Explorer executes a parameterless query and returns the first 100 rows of the dataset.

2. The dataset has one or more required parameters (it may also have optional parameters).

No query is executed until you: 

- Fill in data values for all required parameters and

- Click **Run Query**.
