####Information Workers

Marketplace data can be consumed in the LOB and Productivity Software you already use. The Marketplace provides easy integration with PowerPivot so you can work with the data in Microsoft® Excel. Pricing is low-cost and predictable with the convenience of single source billing and data. 

If you need a custom application, you can save development costs by searching for and subscribing to the application on the Marketplace.

####Developers

The Marketplace gives the developer consistent REST based OData APIs across all datasets to ease development in any platform. When you use Add Service Reference in Visual Studio, you get instant object models and eliminate the tedious and costly need to write abstraction layer code. You can visually build and explore APIs, and preview results without making costly investments in development.

The Marketplace also simplifies marketing your application. When you sell your application through the Marketplace you have immediate access to a large network of potential customers through Microsoft's network of end users.
####Data Publishers

The Marketplace enables you to expand your market through integration in Microsoft’s Information Worker software. Leverage Microsoft’s cloud computing platform for scaling, delivering, reporting, and billing.
