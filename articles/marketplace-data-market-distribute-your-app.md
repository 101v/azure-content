#**Distribute Your Application through the Marketplace**
 -----------
When you sell your application through the Marketplace Store, you have immediate access to a large network of potential customers through Microsoft's network of end users.

Anyone with a Microsoft Azure application or service can market that application through the Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM) store.

To sell your application in the Marketplace, you:

* Register your application with the Marketplace.
* Ensure that your application correctly handles user subscriptions to your application.
* Deploy your application.

This section covers these three topics.
