#   Import Marketplace data into Excel 
 
 -----------

There are two prerequisites:

If you have an Marketplace account and the Excel Marketplace add-in, you can import data directly into your Excel worksheet. Once you have the data in your worksheet you can create graphs, do analysis on the data, and any other Excel action you desire.

###Import a dataset into Power Query

1. Launch Microsoft Excel.

2. Locate and click the **Power Query** tab.

3. On the Power Query ribbon, locate and click **From Other Sources**.

4. On the context menu, locate and click **From Azure Marketplace**. <br>
If you are not signed in to Marketplace, sign in when prompted.

5. All your Marketplace subscriptions are listed on the left side of the screen. Click the subscription from which you want to import data. 
<br>This expands the subscription to show the dataset or datasets you have access to through the subscription.

6. Double-click the dataset you want to use.

The dataset is now loaded into Power Query. If the dataset is very large a subset of the entire dataset may be loaded.

See the [Power Query documentation](https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-us/article/Microsoft-Power-Query-for-Excel-Help-2b433a85-ddfb-420b-9cda-fe0e60b82a94?CorrelationId=1ac209c2-6388-4945-936d-d9f2dba21bde&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) for guidance on using Power Query to transform, save, and share your insights.
