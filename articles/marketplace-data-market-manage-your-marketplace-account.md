#   Manage Your Marketplace Account 

 -----------

The Marketplace uses your account key to authenticate access to your account. You manage your Marketplace account keys when you add an account key, rename, or delete an existing account key. 

	*Warning
	Keep your account keys like you do your money. Do not give them to others unless you want to give them access to your account. 
	Because you cannot delete the default account key, never give it to another person. If you want to give someone access to your account, create an account key that you can delete later.
 -----------
 
###Prerequisites
Before you proceed, ensure that you have:

- A valid Windows Live ID or OrgID. <br>
If you need a Live ID go to the [Windows Live home page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=202643) and sign-up for a Live ID.


- A valid Marketplace account. If you do not have a Marketplace account, go to [Create Your Marketplace Account](/marketplace-data-market-create-your-marketplace-account.md). and follow the instructions there.
