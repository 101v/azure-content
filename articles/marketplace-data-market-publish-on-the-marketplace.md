Leverage Microsofts extensive network of users and partners when you make your data or Microsoft Azure application service available through the Marketplace. You can either charge for access to your data or make it available at no cost to the user, or some combination of the two. Whichever you choose, becoming a WAM data or Azure application service publisher is quick, easy and straight forward.
