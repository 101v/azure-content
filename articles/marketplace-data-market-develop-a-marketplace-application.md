#  Develop a Marketplace Application
 -----------
The Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM) is a global online market where you can publish and sell Azure applications, services, and building block components. Your application, service, or component is not required to access Marketplace data to be sold on the Marketplace. The topics in this section guide you through the process of creating an application to sell on the Marketplace.

This section covers:

- Querying WAM data offerings from within your application.

- Authenticating those using your application to access the WAM.

- Determining which WAM offerings a user subscribes to.

- Distributing you application through the WAM.

At the end of the section are links to example code that leverages the WAM.
