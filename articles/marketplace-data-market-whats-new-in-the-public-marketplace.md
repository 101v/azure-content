#   What's New in the Public Marketplace
 -----------
This topic maintains a record of Marketplace's service improvements and upgrades.
 -----------
###Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM) Februrary 2013 Improvements
In this release we added an Auto-refill option you can enable on any of your paid and limited subscriptions. Requested by you, our customers, Auto-refill is ability to ensure that you, or anyone using your subscription, do not reach your usage limit before the end of your subscription period, and thus avoid the resultant loss of service. Auto-refill does this by cancelling your current subscription and creating a new subscription before you reach your usage limit.

###Marketplace SU9 Improvements

####Support for end users using OrgID
In this release we’ve added support for purchasing commercial offers using OrgID. Members of your organization can subscribe to offers using your organization’s OrgID rather than having to use a personal LiveID.

###Marketplace SU8 Improvements
####View Sample Data
If the publisher enables View Sample Data, you can preview a sample dataset while perusing the list of offerings. For more information, see [Find a Dataset of Interest](./marketplace-data-market-subscribe-to-a-data-offer.md).

####Promotional Discounts
Publishers can create and distribute discount coupon codes to targeted demographics. Customers can use the coupon codes to purchase data or applications at discounted rates. The publisher sets the term and discount rate. For more information, see [Promotional Discounts](./marketplace-data-market-understand-subscriptions.md).

###Marketplace SU7 Improvements

####Support for OrgID
Marketplace integrates with a number of existing Microsoft services. Some of these services, such as Office 365, CRM Online, and Azure, support OrgId for user authentication. WAM seamlessly integrates with services that use OrgID so that a user logged on to one of these services with an OrgID can access WAM without further authentication.

When accessing WAM apart from a service that uses OrgID, the user has the choice of logging on with OrgID or Live ID.

####View Sample Data
Publishers can create a default sample of their data available for customers to view. A predefined query generates the sample data that allows the customer to see but not use the data.

If the publisher enables View Sample Data, customers can preview a sample dataset from the Details page. For more information, see [Pre-Examine the Dataset](./marketplace-data-market-subscribe-to-a-data-offer.md).

###Marketplace SU6 Improvements

####Create Promotional Discounts
Support is added for promotional codes which enable you to motivate others to purchase your datasets through targeted, time limited discounts.

####Retrieve a Customer’s Subscription Info
For Microsoft Azure applications that access Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM) data, it is necessary to determine which datasets the customer is presently subscribed to. The My Datasets service allows appropriately authenticated applications to retrieve information about a user’s Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM) subscriptions.

###Marketplace SU4/SU4.5 Improvements

####Publish Your Data via the Marketplace
Publishing your valuable data on the Marketplace is now quicker and easier than ever. Use the online forms to register as a publisher and create data offerings.

See the topic [Publish on the Marketplace](./marketplace-data-market-publish-on-the-marketplace.md) for details and instructions.

###Marketplace SU3 Improvements

####Application Marketplace
The Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM) is expanded to include commercial applications provisioned by the Marketplace. These applications may or may not consume Marketplace data. 

Now you can create and market your applications and leave provisioning to the Marketplace. Developers can use built-in support for consuming data feeds from the Marketplace within Visual Studio or from any web development tool that supports HTTP.

####Publish Your Marketplace Application
The Marketplace provides a centralized place where you can market your applications. Like data publishers, you do not need to concern yourself with the subscription or billing process, the Marketplace takes care of those details for you. You just cash the checks we send to you.

Guidance for creating a Marketplace application is available at [Develop a Marketplace Application](./marketplace-data-market-develop-a-marketplace-account.md).

####Subscribe to a Marketplace Application
The Marketplace provides a centralized location where you can search for and subscribe to applications that leverage Microsoft Azure services. Browse the store of available applications and subscribe to any that provide you with you need.

Application subscriptions save you the upfront cost of purchasing an application and allow you to subscribe only as you need it. 

Return to the Marketplace often as the list of available applications is dynamic and growing.

####Revamped UI
The Marketplace Home page is updated for SU3 to include application subscriptions in addition to data subscriptions. The links in the ribbon are now:

- **Learn** <br>
Find out more about the Marketplace. You can also initiate the process of becoming a Marketplace publisher from this screen.

- **Applications**<br>
Browse and subscribe to applications.

- **Data**<br>
Browse and subscribe to datasets.


- **My Account** <br>
Manage your account keys and details, and browse you data and application subscriptions.

**Home Page – SU3**

###Marketplace SU2 Improvements

####Service Explorer
The Marketplace Service Explorer UI is changed and now includes additional features. New Service Explorer features allow you to:

- Query your dataset and page through, jump to the beginning, end, or specific page of the result set. You can also change result set views (table, chart, .xml) with a single click of a button. See [Query a Dataset](./marketplace-data-market-query-a-dataset.md).

- Visualize a query result as a bar, column, or line chart right in Service Explorer. See **Visualize a Dataset**.

- Export your query result in any of a number of file formats. See [Download from the Marketplace to a file](./marketplace-data-market-download-from-the-marketplace-to-a-file.md).

- Capture the query url for use in other programs. See [Get the Query URL](./marketplace-data-market-get-the-query-url.md).

####Trial Subscriptions
Some publishers of paid subscriptions provide one month free trials so you can try their datasets before you commit to purchasing. See [Subscribe to the Dataset](./marketplace-data-market-subscribe-to-a-data-offer.md).

####International Billing
The Marketplace now supports eight new international markets and four new currencies. See [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217257](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217257).

####OAuth 2.0 Support
Marketplace's support for OAuth 2.0 (see [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/)) enables application development and distribution with the Marketplace taking the responsibility to manage and bill the individual application user. See [Implement OAuth in your Marketplace App](./marketplace-data-market-implement-oauth-in-your-marketplace-app.md).

####Social Networking Support
Find a dataset you think others would like? Click the **Data** tab then click the "Like" icon below the dataset description. 

Click the **Data** tab then the Facebook icon in the lower right corner of the screen to follow the Marketplace on Facebook®. 

Catch the Marketplace on You Tube®. Click **Data** tab and then the You Tube icon in the lower right corner of the screen.
