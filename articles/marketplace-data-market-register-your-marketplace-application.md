# Register your Marketplace Application

 -----------
When you register your application with the Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM) the Marketplace takes care of user subscription and billing for you. All you do is cash the checks when they arrive. This topic walks you through the Marketplace application registration process.

 -----------

### Your Marketplace Application

1. Sign in to the Marketplace.

2. Navigate your browser to [Application Registration page](https://datamarket.azure.com/register?redirect=%2Fdeveloper%2Fapplications).

3. Click **Register**.

4. On the **Register your application** page, enter a unique Client ID for your application. <br>
For example, MyGreatAppv10.

		*Important  
		The Client ID can only be set when you create a registration and cannot be changed later on.
 
5. Enter the name of your application. <br>
For example, My Great Application v1.0

6. Enter the application's post consent redirect URI.
<br><br>The application’s post consent redirect URI is the URL that you want the user’s browser redirected to after the consent flow is completed successfully.

8. Enter a description for your application.

9. Click **Create**.
