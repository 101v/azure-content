#Query Marketplace Datasets from your App
 -----------
All data from the Marketplace is exposed as RESTful OData feeds. The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data. OData builds upon Web technologies such as HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) and JSON to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.  OData is able to expose and access information from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, relational databases, file systems, content management systems and traditional Web sites.

OData is consistent with the way the Web works. It uses an HTTP-based, uniform interface for interacting with resources. The use of core Web principles allows OData to enable data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools thereby making development easier and faster. Development is also eased by downloadable service references and classes provided by the Marketplace.

If you want to query a dataset without writing code, you can do that from Service Explorer. See the topic [Explore a Dataset with Service Explorer](./marketplace-data-market-explore-a-dataset-with-service-explorer.md) and its sub-topics for more information.
