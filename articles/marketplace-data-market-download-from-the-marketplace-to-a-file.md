 -----------

From the Windows Azure Marketplace (WAM) query results screen, you can export the query results to other software. This topic covers downloading your query results to a .CSV file. To download your query results to PowerPivot, see [Download from the Marketplace to PowerPivot](./marketplace-data-market-download-from-the-marketplace-to-powerpivot.md).

###Prerequisites

- A valid Windows Live ID or OrgID. <br>
If you need a Live ID go to the [Windows Live home page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=202643) and sign-up for a Live ID.


- A valid Marketplace account. If you do not have a Marketplace account, go to  [Create Your Marketplace Account](./marketplace-data-market-create-your-marketplace-account.md) and follow the instructions there.


- A subscription to a dataset of interest. If you have not subscribed to a dataset, go to  [Subscribe to a Data Offer](./marketplace-data-market-subscribe-to-a-data-offer.md) and follow the instructions there.

- A dataset that you have queried using Service Explorer. (See [Query a Dataset](./marketplace-data-market-query-a-dataset.md) for more information)

###Downloading your query result set to Excel or a CSV file
After you query a dataset using Service Explorer (See [Query a Dataset](./marketplace-data-market-query-a-dataset.md) for more information.), your download options are listed in the upper right of the results screen. (Figure 1)

2. When presented with the dialog informing you of how many transactions this download will consume, decide whether you want to continue with the download or cancel it, then click **OK** or **Cancel**. (Figure 3)<br>

3. After the download completes, select **Open**, **Save** or **Cancel**.

- **Open** – launches Excel and populates a worksheet with the query results.


- **Save** – saves the query results as a .CSV file. <br>
If you click the down arrow on **Save**, then select **Save As**, you can specify where to save the .CSV file.


- **Cancel** – terminates the process. <br>
However, since the download has already taken place you have consumed the specified number of transactions.
